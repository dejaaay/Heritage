            One of the natural hot springs produced by Mt. Pinatubo's eruption in 1991 is the Puning Hot Spring, which is situated in the province of Pampanga. The hot spring is situated in Porac, a village at the base of a volcano surrounded by 
            lush mountain ranges. The phrase "punang" or "mapunang," which means "full of trees," was the source of the location's name before it was changed to its current form. The first settlers of the area following the eruption, the hamlet of Aetas, are in charge of maintaining the hot spring. Visitors can stay in a number of cottages inside the hot spring. In the neighborhood, there are also restrooms and a shower facility. The hot water in the pools at Puning ranges in temperature from 40 degrees to 70 degrees. The water comes from the Sacobia River and is naturally heated by the active volcano because it is close by. The location also has pools with cold water for those who like it.
